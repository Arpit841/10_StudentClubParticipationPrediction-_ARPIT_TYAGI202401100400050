# Student Club Participation Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Club Participation Prediction** project is designed to predict whether a student is likely to participate in college clubs and extracurricular activities based on their academic records, interests, demographics, and past participation history. The goal is to assist college administrators and club coordinators in improving student engagement and tailoring outreach efforts more effectively.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict student participation in clubs using machine learning models.
- Analyze key factors that influence club participation.
- Help institutions make data-driven decisions for club promotions and event planning.
- Personalize club recommendations for students.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** – for machine learning models
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for development and analysis

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- Student ID
- Academic performance (GPA/grades)
- Demographic details (age, gender, department, year)
- Club interests (survey-based or inferred)
- Historical participation in clubs/events
- Attendance records

> *Note: This project uses a synthetic or anonymized dataset to ensure privacy.*

## 🔍 Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered student data from academic and extracurricular sources.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and encoded the data, handled missing values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified patterns and trends in participation.
4. **Model Training**: Used classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
5. **Evaluation**: Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Prediction**: Developed a system to predict participation likelihood and recommend relevant clubs.

---

## 📈 Results

- Achieved over **85% accuracy** with Random Forest Classifier.
- Identified key features influencing participation, such as GPA, department, and previous involvement.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integrate a web-based UI for student recommendations.
- Include NLP for analyzing student feedback and interest.
- Expand dataset to include more institutions and years.
